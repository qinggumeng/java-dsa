# So I have recently gotten a book on Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2nd edition) by Robert Lafore and was wondering how I could get the workshop applets to work.

The workshop applets are basically small animated programs that visually show you how the Data Structures and Algorithms in this book work.

The applets can be downloaded from many different locations, including university websites, such as:

http://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs206/spring2004/lafore.html

http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie22/resources/lafore/

http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~markov/ccsu_courses/501Syllabus.html

http://www.informit.com/store/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-java-9780672324536

but the problem is that they generate security exceptions, and Java gives no way of allowing the applets to work.

Whats worse is that the files only contain the .class files and not the source code files. I have tried using a decompiler (the one in the intelij ide) and reconstructing the project but it does not seem to decompile perfectly.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated because from the reviews ive read, these applets make understanding the algorithms and data structures much easier.
